## Depth Map Prediction from a Single Image using a Multi-Scale Deep Network
This implementation is based on [imran3180/depth-map-prediction](https://github.com/imran3180/depth-map-prediction) 
with minor modifications.

A script called evaluate_im.py is added to obtain inference result given 1 input image.
